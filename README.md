Your goal is to create a machine learning model, fit it to the training data, and
make predictions on the test set. When finished, save the code in an ipynb file and
the predictions in a CSV file.

- Create all the code in Python;
- The data will be available in two CSV files, containing training and
test data, along with a description of each column in the set;
- Perform exploratory data analysis, creating graphs that demonstrate patterns
between the dependent variable and the other columns;
- Develop a feature engineering pipeline if deemed necessary,
adding predictive value to the available data;
- Perform the necessary preprocessing on the database, including
normalization, treatment of null values ​​and outliers;
- Validate the models, using metrics you deem most appropriate for
the problem;
- Test with different hyperparameters, model ensembles, or any technique you find useful to improve model performance;
- Extra: With the model performing predictions correctly, create a Python API
that will receive a CSV file with new data, perform the prediction, and return the
variable predicted by the model for each new instance.
